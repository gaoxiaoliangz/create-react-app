# ✨ @gxl/react-scripts ✨

This is a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Added features includes:

- scss support
- css modules support (filename ends with `.module.css` or `.module.scss` will have css modules enabled)
- alias `@` -> `src`
- css source map support in development
- added config.js to support customizing webpack and webpack dev server

You can create your react project using

```
create-react-app app_name --scripts-version=@gxl/react-scripts
```

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>
